    - Hack Productions was an integral part of Hack Quarantine, and without them we wouldn't have come close to providing the vital tech education to the global hackathon community during the coronavirus pandemic that we did.
    - From day one, Hack Productions took care of all our AV needs - from sourcing and colocating server hardware, dealing with our unique livestream needs and providing round-the-clock assistance with whatever we needed. They also did a great job coordinating with our workshop hosts and outside platforms, assisting with our scheduling and making sure we had all the production assets that were needed. This took a huge weight off our back, and allowed our organiser team to focus on running the event.
    - Hack Quarantine was a unique event with unique needs, and Hack Productions was exceptionally responsive and flexible when dealing with these needs. Despite tight deadlines and constant challenges, they managed to deliver a great viewer experience and were a wonderful group of people to work with. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending Hack Productions to anyone looking to run a digital event or who is needing AV at a physical event, and look forward to working with them again in the future.

    - CovHack's presentations, demos and awards ran smoothly thanks to Will's all-inclusive Audio/Visual solution! Everything from managing slides and background graphics, to lighting, to making sure hackers' demos ran on time was handled seamlessly with impressive competence and attention to detail. This helped give CovHack a professional feel while maintaining a fun and friendly environment.
    - Will also recorded all audio and visuals from the demos, allowing our videographer to combine these with a camera feed to be publically released - this enables us to add public visibility and accessibility usually only achieved by large conferences.
    - The edge Will's A/V gives to events is incredible and I would love to welcome him back to run A/V at CovHack in the future!

    - Will's constant devotion to our event and the AV solutions involved were far more than anyone could have expected for a volunteer. He created animated assets that adhered to the branding guidelines and looked stunning and really added to the experience of opening ceremony. He also helped form the basis of our opening and closing ceremony slides and made doing finalist presentations a breeze due to picture-in-picture really helping for hardware hacks. 
    - I first met Will at HackTheMidlands 4.0 and after seeing what an impressive job he and the rest of the team did with the sound, lighting and visuals, I almost begged him to be a part of ManMetHacks. He was a perfect addition to the team > and the event couldn't have run smoother if we had tried thanks to his dedication and hard work.

    - Will ran the A/V for our opening talks and helped bring a couple of great ideas about how to add polish and flair to bring energy to the room. He was able to adapt to our needs on-the-fly and keep transitions > smooth between speakers.
    - Will also did a fantastic job of running our finalist presentations entirely by himself. Having heard about his legendary(!) A/V skills at OxfordHack 2019, I had full faith that Will would pull through and keep our presentations seamless and on schedule – and he stepped up to the challenge and ran the presentations with no drama. I was able to step back and focus on other things while Will got teams quickly and effectively onboarded with the relevant A/V set up, and was able to professionally handle issues and special requirements. I would love to have Will at every event I'm at!
